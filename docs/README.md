# OctoAcme Project Management Process Overview

## Purpose

This documentation centralizes OctoAcme’s project management knowledge, making it easily accessible and versioned for all team members. It allows us to:
- Provide a searchable, single source of truth for processes and rationale
- Encode best practices and team insights into reusable documentation
- Accelerate onboarding and reduce single-person dependency risk
- Enable consistent, repeatable execution for all project types

## Principles

- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability in every action.
- **Iterative delivery**: Deliver outcomes in small, testable increments.
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has a Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead.
- **Data-informed**: Make decisions supported by measurable impact.
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage open feedback and learning throughout.

## Project Lifecycle

1. **Initiation**
   - Problem, stakeholders, early buy-in.
   - Project One-pager, initial risks, stakeholder comms.
2. **Planning**
   - Breakdown into actionable increments.
   - Prioritized backlog, timeline, resource ID, risk register.
3. **Execution & Tracking**
   - Work tracked with project board (Backlog → Done).
   - Daily standups, weekly sync, regular demos.
   - Testing, quality, and metrics monitoring.
4. **Release & Deployment**
   - Phased, checklist-driven releases with smoke testing and rollback plans.
   - Standardized release notes.
5. **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement**
   - Lightweight, action-focused retros after milestones or incidents.

## Roles

- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, risks, and comms.
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes work.
- **Developers & QA**: Deliver, test, and validate; collaborate on design.
- **Stakeholders**: Provide requirements, feedback, and approvals.

## Communication

- Weekly PM/PdM syncs; twice-weekly standups.
- Monthly stakeholder updates.
- Regular status reports, risk reviews, and escalation paths.
